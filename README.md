This took me about 40 minutes, total.  I was thinking about re-writing
this in Bacon, but my Bacon is pretty raw.  At best, I could
propertize the cards to create a new card (i.e. a new state) every
time a ball came in, but that seemed a little overwrought.  

I'm sad that it requires underscore, but Node's native reduce doesn't
support object iteration, only arrays.

It was nice to have an opportunity to hack Coffee and Node again.
